# n3n

n3n is a light VPN software which makes it easy to create virtual networks
bypassing intermediate firewalls.

In order to start using n3n, two elements are required:

- A _supernode_: it allows edge nodes to announce and discover other nodes. It
  must have a port publicly accessible on internet.
- _edge_ nodes: the nodes which will be a part of the virtual networks

A virtual network shared between multiple edge nodes in n3n is called a
_community_. A single supernode can relay multiple communities and a single
computer can be part of multiple communities at the same time. An encryption
key can be used by the edge nodes to encrypt the packets within their
community.

n3n tries to establish a direct peer-to-peer connection via udp between the
edge nodes when possible. When this is not possible (usually due to special NAT
devices), the supernode is also used to relay the packets.

n3n was originally based on an older n2n project and hopes to keep protocol
compatiblilty with that.

## License

- Any new self-contained tools or modules are licensed GPL-2.0-only.
- Existing code is licensed GPL-3-only.
- There are multiple distinct copyright holders throughout the codebase.
- There is no Contributor Licence Agreement and thus there is no single body that
  can take ownership of the code and/or change the licensing.

## Quick Setup

Beward that while Debian (and those based on it) Linux distributions do appear
to provide n2n as a package, it is based on an antique version and is not
compatible with this.

Alternatively, up-to-date packages for most distributions are available as
part of the [latest release](https://github.com/n42n/n3n/releases/latest).

On host1 run:

```sh
$ sudo edge -c mynetwork -k mysecretpass -a 192.168.100.1 -f -l supernode.ntop.org:7777 start
```

On host2 run:

```sh
$ sudo edge -c mynetwork -k mysecretpass -a 192.168.100.2 -f -l supernode.ntop.org:7777 start
```

Now the two hosts can ping each other.

**IMPORTANT** It is strongly advised to choose a custom community name (`-c`)
and a secret encryption key (`-k`) in order to prevent other users from
connecting to your computer. For the privacy of your data sent and to reduce
the server load of `supernode.ntop.org`, it is also suggested to set up a
custom supernode as explained below.


## Setting up a Custom Supernode

You can create your own infrastructure by setting up a supernode on a public
server (e.g. a VPS). You just need to open a single port (1234 in the example
below) on your firewall (usually `iptables`).

1. Install the n3n package
2. Edit `/etc/n3n/supernode.conf` and add the following:
   ```
   -p=1234
   ```
3. Start the supernode service with `sudo systemctl start supernode`
4. Optionally enable supernode start on boot: `sudo systemctl enable supernode`

Now the supernode service should be up and running on port 1234. On your edge
nodes you can now specify `-l your_supernode_ip:1234` to use it. All the edge
nodes must use the same supernode.


## Manual Compilation

On Linux, compilation from source is straight forward:

```sh
./autogen.sh
./configure
make

# optionally install
make install
```

For Windows, MacOS, optimizations and general building options, please check out [Building documentation](doc/Building.md) for compilation and running.

**IMPORTANT** It is generally recommended to use the [latest stable
release](https://github.com/n42n/n3n/releases). Please note that the current
_main_ branch usually is not guaranteed to be backward compatible neither with
the latest stable release nor with previous _main_ states. On the other hand,
if you dare to try bleeding edge features, you are encouraged to compile from
_main_ â€“ just keep track of sometimes rapidly occuring changes. Feedback in the
_Issues_ section is appreciated.


## Security Considerations

When payload encryption is enabled (provide a key using `-k`), the supernode will not be able to decrypt
the traffic exchanged between two edge nodes but it will know that edge A is talking with edge B.

The choice of encryption schemes that can be applied to payload has recently been enhanced. Please have
a look at [Crypto description](doc/Crypto.md) for a quick comparison chart to help make a choice. n2n edge nodes use 
AES encryption by default. Other ciphers can be chosen using the `-A_` option.

A benchmark of the encryption methods is available when compiled from source with `tools/n2n-benchmark`.

The header which contains some metadata like the virtual MAC address of the
edge nodes, their IP address, their real hostname and the community name
optionally can be encrypted applying the `community.header_encryption=true`
option to the edges.


## Advanced Configuration

More information about communities, support for multiple supernodes, routing, traffic restrictions and on how to run an edge as 
a service is available in the [more detailed documentation](doc/Advanced.md).
